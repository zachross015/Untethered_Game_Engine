# Untethered Game Engine
Game engine under the development of Zach Ross. This project is almost completely for learning purposes, but is also intended for the help in the development in games. It uses [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org) as a graphics and sound engine.
## todo
### Collision Detection
- [X] Implement Seperate Axis Theorem
- [ ] Add circle capabilities for the Seperate Axis Theorem
- [X] Implement Quad Tree

### Physics
- [ ] Create intuitive way to derive class into child classes
- [ ] Implement Laws of Inertia into movement and Collision
- [ ] Implement Gravity options

### GUI
<<<<<<< HEAD

### Misc/Unsorted
- [ ] Game Camera
- [ ] Mac Support
- [ ] Linux Support
- [X] Eliminate BoundedAnimation Class and switch all functionality to Animation Class
 - ~~Add another line to Animation Text files with either 0 or 1 that is bool for whether or not the Animation has bounds~~
- [ ] Switch all animation files to custom file format
